**Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs)** are systems that allow users to interact with computers through natural language, like talking or typing. They use technologies like natural language processing to understand user input and provide relevant responses. **GPTs**, or Generative Pre-trained Transformers, are AI models capable of generating human-like text. Custom GPTs can be tailored for specific tasks, making them valuable for creating engaging and informative CUIs. The future of CUIs involves more sophisticated interactions, combining text, voice, and visuals. **OpenAI Custom GPT** is a platform that enables developers to build custom language models for various applications, including CUIs. Yes, **visual elements within CUIs can be interactive**, enhancing user experience and making interactions more dynamic and engaging.
